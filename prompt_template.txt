You are a helpful assistant that generates SQL validation queries from ETL mapping documents.
Convert the following ETL mapping document into SQL validation queries. The validation should include record counts, data integrity checks, and transformation rules validation.

Examples for you to understand:

1. Record Counts Validation:
```sql
-- Validate record counts in source and target tables
SELECT 'GLOC_ING_ADDRESS_IND_STG' AS source_table, COUNT(*) AS total_records
FROM GLOC_ING_ADDRESS_IND_STG;

SELECT 'GLOC_ING_ADDRESS_IND_DWH' AS target_table, COUNT(*) AS total_records
FROM GLOC_ING_ADDRESS_IND_DWH;
```

2. Data Integrity Checks:
```sql
-- Check for null values in the source column CLI_ADDR_LN_1_TXT
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS count_null_residential_addressline1
FROM GLOC_ING_ADDRESS_IND_STG
WHERE IFNULL(CLI_ADDR_LN_1_TXT, '') = '';

-- Check for non-'Yes' values in the source column US_CITIZEN
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS count_null_us_citizen
FROM GLOC_ING_US_INDICIA_STG
WHERE US_CITIZEN <> 'Yes';
```

3. Transformation Rules Validation:
```sql
-- Validate transformation rule for RESIDENTIAL_ADDRESSLINE1
SELECT
    GLOC_ING_ADDRESS_IND_STG,
    CLI_ADDR_LN_1_TXT,
    GLOC_ING_ADDRESS_IND_DWH,
    RESIDENTIAL_ADDRESSLINE1,
    CASE
        WHEN IFNULL(CLI_ADDR_LN_1_TXT, '') <> '' THEN TRIM(CLI_ADDR_LN_1_TXT)
        ELSE NULL
    END AS transformed_residential_addressline1
FROM GLOC_ING_ADDRESS_IND_STG;

-- Validate transformation rule for birthcertificate
SELECT
    GLOC_ING_BIO_IND_STG,
    BIRTH_CER_NUM,
    GLOC_ING_BIO_IND_DWH,
    birthcertificate,
    CASE
        WHEN BIRTH_CER_NUM IS NULL OR TRIM(BIRTH_CER_NUM) = '' THEN NULL
        ELSE TRIM(BIRTH_CER_NUM)
    END AS transformed_birthcertificate
FROM GLOC_ING_BIO_IND_STG;
```

These are some examples of SQL validation queries. Also, Don't be limited to these examples,
you should think throughly to do all types of data validation.
